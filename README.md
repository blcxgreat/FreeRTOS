# FreeRTOS
Embedded system practice

Coded by Chunguang(Eric) Xie based on the Texas Instruments' freeRTOS example

This is a practice project for RTOS using TIVA tm4c123 mic-controller and the parts for my trafficlight design.
The control part is replaced by RTOS but all the other functions remain the same.

Enjoy!
